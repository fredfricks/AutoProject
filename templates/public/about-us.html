<p>There's this notion that to grow a business, you have to be ruthless. But we know there's a better way to grow. One where what's good for the bottom line is also good for customers. We believe businesses can grow with a conscience, and succeed with a soul — and that they can do it with inbound. That's why we've created an ecosystem uniting automobile community to help businesses grow better every day.</p>

<p><span>Our Story</span>  </p>
<br>
<p>As fellow graduate students at Alabian Solutions Limited in 2021, Fredrick, Korede and Ebine noticed a shift in the way people shop and buy. Consumers were no longer tolerating interruptive bids for their attention — in fact, they'd gotten really, really good at ignoring them.

  From this shift, a company was born: HubSpot. It was founded on "inbound", the notion that people don't want to be interrupted by marketers or harassed by salespeople — they want to be helped.
  
  Today, the inbound movement continues to empower businesses around the world to stop interrupting, start helping, and return their focus to the customer.</p>
